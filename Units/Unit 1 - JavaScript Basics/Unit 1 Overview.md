# 🧱 Unit 1 – JavaScript Basics

### 🎯 Unit Overview
In this unit, you’ll explore the fundamentals of JavaScript — the language that powers the web.  
By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Explain what JavaScript is and how it evolved (ES6).
- Create and use variables to store data.
- Work with strings, numbers, and Booleans.
- Use conditionals and loops to make your programs think and repeat.
- Write clean, readable code following best practices.

### 📘 Lesson Summaries

#### **1.1 – JavaScript Intro**
Learn what JavaScript is, where it runs, and how it’s used to build interactive web pages.  
You’ll practice writing your first code with `console.log()`, adding comments, and declaring variables with `let` and `const`.

#### **1.2 – Data Types in JavaScript**
Understand how different kinds of data work in JavaScript.  
You’ll work with numbers and strings, use mathematical operators, and try out string methods like `.charAt()`, `.indexOf()`, `.slice()`, and `.repeat()`.

#### **1.3 – Boolean, Undefined, Null & Immutability**
Learn about the logic behind programming using Booleans, `undefined`, and `null`.  
You’ll also understand why primitive values can’t be changed directly (immutability) and practice logical operations using `&&`, `||`, and `!`.

#### **1.4 – Conditionals and Loops**
Put your knowledge together to control your program’s behavior.  
You’ll use conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`) to make decisions and loops (`for`, `while`) to repeat actions.  
You’ll also learn when to use each and how to avoid infinite loops.
