# Lab 001 – JavaScript Intro

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Explain what JavaScript is and why it’s important..
- Use `console.log()` to produce output.
- Declare variables with `let` and `const`.
- Reassign values using `let` and observe type changes.
- Follow naming rules with camelCase and descriptive names.

---

## 📖 Pre-Lab Reading
- Open the included PDF: `JS_Javascript Intro.pdf`
- Sections: "What is JavaScript?", "Basic Syntax", "Output", "Variables", "Naming Rules"

## 🧰 Setup
- Open your terminal in this lab folder.
- Run file with:
  ```bash
  node src/Lab001_JSIntro.js
  ```
- Edit only: `src/Lab001_JSIntro.js`

---

## 📝 Tasks
1. Write a program that prints your **full name** using `console.log()`.
2. Create a variable `favoriteFood` with `let`.  
   - First assign it `"Steak"`.  
   - Then reassign it to `"Pizza"`.  
   - Print both values to the console.
3. Create a variable `mystery` with `let`.  
   - First assign it a string (e.g., `"Hello"`).  
   - Then assign it a number (e.g., `42`).  
   - Print both values with their type using `typeof`.
4. Create a constant `schoolName` with `const`.  
   - Assign it your school’s name.  
   - Try reassigning it and observe the error.
5. Create three valid variable names in **camelCase** and assign them values. Print them.

## 🚀 Stretch Goals (optional)
- Create a variable that stores your age. Print `"I am X years old"` using string concatenation.  
- Use template literals (`` `I am ${age} years old` ``) to print the same sentence.

## 🎟 Exit Ticket
Answer in 2–3 sentences each:
1. Why is it important to use descriptive variable names instead of short ones like `x` or `a`?  
2. What is the difference between `let` and `const`?  
3. Why might changing the type of a variable (string → number) cause problems in bigger programs?  
4. What’s one thing about JavaScript from today’s reading that surprised you?
